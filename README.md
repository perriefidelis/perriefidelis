# About Me 👩🏽‍🔬 👩🏽‍🎨 🥑
As a results-driven, analytical and entrepreneurial professional, I bring extensive experience in strategic ecosystem development and a proven track record in driving adoption, innovation and growth. I have a background in product design and have spent the past 6 years leading successful development initiatives in industries such as fin-tech, health tech, Crypto and Web 3, Edu-tech, and e-commerce. 

I am a strategic thinker, problem solver and natural leader, with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what is possible and being the first to bring new and exciting initiatives to market. My strong analytical skills and passion for creativity and design, make me confident in my ability to lead and manage all aspects of the product development process.

In the past years, I have helped to build, maintain and grow some amazing communities, within and beyond Africa.
